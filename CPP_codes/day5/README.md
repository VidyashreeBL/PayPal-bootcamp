#Scrabble Word Suggestor

The code provides user with a set of words that can be used ( based on the rack of tiles available ) under the following situations:

* The user has to make the first move ( both normal and empty tile cases are handled )
* The user provides constraints on the words. ( eg. the word should have c in 3rd position )

The sowpods dictionary is being used fo rthe purpose of word validation ( http://www.freescrabbledictionary.com/sowpods/download/sowpods.txt ).
